Hello，Lee

There are some points to clarify with you:

1.  The team develops 3 types of accounts :  
- ми створюємо, чи він має можливість створити?

- students (beginner clients)
- traders 
- admin (for managing user functionality).

2. Different types of users may have different functionality. 
3. The difference in functionality for various user types is in their ability to use AI - and scripting.


4. The team  developes the ability for admin to share custom templates and basic features with clients (indidvidually and in groups).


 - - - - - -- - - - - - -- - - - - - - -

5. Connection to CRM ? 
  - what exactly it means to connect CRM to platform? How it should affect the trading platform?

 
6. Ability to scan the different markets for signals with proprietary indicators and systems. 
   Could this then place an order on the chart?  - що значить це формулювання? це змога створювати ордери скриптингом?
