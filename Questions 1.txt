There are some points to clarify with you:
1.  The team develops 3 types of accounts :  
- students (beginner clients)
- traders 
- admin (for managing user functionality).
2. Different types of users may have different functionality. 
3. The difference in functionality for various user types is in their ability to use AI - and scripting.
4. The team  developes the ability for admin to share custom templates and basic features with clients (indidvidually and in groups).
5. Connection to CRM ? 
6. Ability to scan the different markets for signals with proprietary indicators and systems. 
   Could this then place an order on the chart?
